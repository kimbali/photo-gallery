<p>Testing IONIC with React js</p>

<h2>Things to know</h2>

Every time you perform a build (e.g. ionic build) that updates your web directory (default: build), you'll need to copy those changes into your native projects:

```ionic cap copy```

Note: After making updates to the native portion of the code (such as adding a new plugin), use the sync command:

```ionic cap sync```
